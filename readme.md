Welcome to GTM documentation
=====================================


This program implements the generalized 4x4 transfer matrix (GTM) method poposed in 
[Passler, N. C. and Paarmann, A., JOSA B 34, 2128 (2017)](http://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.34.002128)
and corrected in [Passler, N. C. and Paarmann, A., JOSA B 36, 3246 (2019)](http://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.36.003246). 
A Matlab code can be downloaded on [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.601496).

As of March 2020, it furthers implements the layer-resolved absorption method proposed in
[Passler, N. C., Jeannin, M. and Paarmann, A.,](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03832)
A Matlab code is also available for this update on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3648041).

This Python implementation also relies on inputs from D. Dietze's FSRStools code
